When you get your Museum in a Box, the box knows which objects are in it and can tell you things about them. That's because of The Brain, a microcomputer like a Raspberry Pi. There are a few peripherals too, like an RFID reader, speakers, and a screen. The brain also keeps a note of any time an object comes across it. This is called the BOOP LOG.
