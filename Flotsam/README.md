Handy bits and pieces that aren't crucial to the Brain or its operation, but are handy to have stashed away in source control.

## Files

 * [DisplayCard.docx](DisplayCard.docx) - a simple "what is this?" card to position next to the Museum in a Box if it's on display unattended somewhere.  Like the sort of thing that's next to an exhibit in a museum.  Works remarkably well just laser-printed and spray mounted to a piece of white foamcore.
 * [TagSizeTemplates.svg](TagSizeTemplates.svg) - laser-cutter outline file to cut a variety of common NFC tag sizes, so you can check them against prints to see what fits before you buy tags.
