One moment please. I'm just warming up.

OK! Ready to go.

Hi! So, you've worked it out. That's great.

You've just booped me on what we call the Brain. Everything in Museum in a Box has a little metal sticker on it. You can boop them, just like you did me. So what are you going to pick first? Have fun!

Me again. Hi.
Seems like you haven't connected to Wi-Fi yet. If you want to try that now, just boop the Wi-Fi widget now, and we'll get you all set up.

Me again. No updates from HQ.

Hi. You've done twenty boops today!

Hi. We've updated your British Museum set with new information!

WI-FI SETUP

Hello there!

Welcome to Museum in a Box!

I'm your WiFi Configurator. You can boop me on the box any time you need to change your WiFi settings. Look for the WiFi network called "museuminabox" on your computer or phone now and we'll get you all set up.
